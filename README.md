# Project in Denoising The Dermatology Images: CNN-based Stacked Denoising Autoencoder in Dermatology Domain

This is the repository for my Bachelor's Thesis at the Technical University of Denmark. This project is a proof of concept, investigating the CNN-based Stacked Denoising Autoencoder in improving the light condition of dermoscopic and cell-phone images.

The repository consists of Two files. In the Experiment file the related modules used to train the model and test the model and analysis of the results is provided. The DataAnalysis file consists of the script of data cleaning and data analysis.

# Data

The project uses two datasets, Imagine Dataset and a subset of The International Skin Imaging Collaboratio (ISIC) Corpus. The Imagine Dataset is a private dataset containing cell-phone images. The link to ISIC dataset is provided below.

This project uses a subset of Psoriasis class from Imagine Dataset and the following classes from ISIC dataset:<br />
* basal cell carcinoma<br />
* melanoma<br />
* Pigmented Benign Keratosis<br />
* Nevus<br />
